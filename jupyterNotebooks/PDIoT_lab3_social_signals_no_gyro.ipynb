        "\n",
        "In time series Activity Recognition, a sliding window is a commonly used technique to segment continuous sensor data (such as accelerometer readings) into smaller, fixed-length overlapping or non-overlapping time intervals, or windows. Each window contains a sequence of sensor measurements that represent a short period of time, and this segmented data is used to extract features or make predictions about the activity happening within that window.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts of a Sliding Window\n",
        "1.   **Window Size:** This refers to the length of each segment or window, typically defined in terms of the number of time steps or the duration (e.g., 2 seconds). The window size should be chosen carefully to capture enough information about the activity without making the window too large.\n",
        "2.   **Step Size:** The step size determines how far the window moves forward after each step. If the step size is smaller than the window size, the windows will overlap. For example, if the window size is 5 seconds and the step size is 2 seconds, there will be a 3-second overlap between consecutive windows. Overlapping windows provide more data for analysis and can help smooth out predictions by capturing transitional activities.\n",
        "3.   **Non-Overlapping Windows:** If the step size is equal to the window size, the windows do not overlap. This method provides distinct segments of data but may miss transitional phases between activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Sliding Windows for Activity Recognition?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Segmentation of Continuous Data: Activity recognition systems work with continuous streams of sensor data, and the sliding window helps segment these into manageable pieces to classify activities within specific intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Context Capturing: Human activities are often complex and spread across time. By using a sliding window, you can capture context across a short duration, which may include transitions or small fluctuations in the activity (e.g., a person moving from sitting to standing).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Feature Extraction: Within each window, features such as mean, variance, frequency domain features, etc., can be extracted to help classify the activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Real-Time Recognition: In real-time systems, the sliding window allows for continuous monitoring and updating of predictions as new data arrives.\n",

        "\n",
        "Input Parameters\n",
        "* `input_shape`: Specifies the shape of the input data. It represents (timesteps, features), where timesteps refer to the length of the time series (e.g., 50 windows), and features represent the number of measurements in each time step (e.g., accelerometer readings).\n",

        "Returns\n",

        "<hr>\n",
        "\n",
        "### Function Breakdown\n",
        "1.   Model Initialization:\n",
        "    * `model = Sequential()`: Initializes a Sequential model, which means layers will be stacked on top of each other in a linear fashion.\n",
        "2.   First Convolutional Layer\n",
        "    * `Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape)`\n",
        "        * This is the first 1D convolutional layer\n",
        "        * `filters=64`: The layer applies 64 filters (or kernels) over the input data.\n",
        "        * `kernel_size=3`: Each filter will cover 3 timesteps at a time (a window of 3).\n",
        "        * `activation='relu'`: The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function introduces non-linearity and helps the model learn complex patterns.\n",
        "        * `input_shape=input_shape`: Specifies the shape of the input data.\n",
        "    * `MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2)`: This pooling layer reduces the dimensionality of the data by taking the maximum value from each 2-timestep window (`pool_size=2`). This helps reduce computational complexity and captures the most important features.\n",
        "3. Second Convolutional Layer:\n",
        "    * `Conv1D(filters=128, kernel_size=3, activation='relu')`\n",
        "        * This is the second convolutional layer, similar to the first, but with 128 filters, which allow the network to learn more complex features from the data.\n",
        "        * `kernel_size=3` and activation='relu' function in the same way as the first Conv1D layer.\n",
        "    * `MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2)`: Another pooling layer to downsample the output, further reducing the data’s dimensionality.\n",
        "4. Flattening Layer:\n",
        "    * `Flattening`: Converts the 2D output of the convolutional and pooling layers into a 1D vector. This is necessary because the next layer is fully connected, and it requires a 1D input.\n",
        "5. Fully Connected Layer:\n",
        "    * `Dense(128, activation='relu')`: This is a fully connected layer with 128 units/neurons. Each neuron is connected to every input from the flattened output. The ReLU activation function is used again to introduce non-linearity and help the model learn complex relationships.\n",
        "6. Dropout Layer:\n",
        "    * `Dropout(0.5)`: This layer randomly sets 50% of the neurons to zero during training to prevent overfitting. It helps the model generalize better to unseen data.\n",
        "7. Output Layer:\n",
        "    * `Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')`: This is the output layer with num_classes neurons, one for each class in the classification problem. The softmax activation function ensures the output values represent probabilities that sum to 1, useful for multi-class classification.\n",
        "8. Compiling the model\n",
        "    * model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']):\n",
